## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### WebSocket Architecture

```python
# Real-time collaboration server
class CollaborationServer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*")
        self.active_sessions = {}
        self.user_cursors = {}
        
    @socketio.on('join_session')
    def handle_join_session(self, data):
        session_id = data['session_id']
        user_id = data['user_id']
        
        join_room(session_id)
        self.add_user_to_session(session_id, user_id)
        
        emit('user_joined', {
            'user_id': user_id,
            'session_id': session_id,
            'active_users': self.get_session_users(session_id)
        }, room=session_id)
    
    @socketio.on('live_transcript_update')
    def handle_transcript_update(self, data):
        session_id = data['session_id']
        transcript_chunk = data['transcript']
        timestamp = data['timestamp']
        
        # Broadcast to all session participants
        emit('transcript_chunk', {
            'content': transcript_chunk,
            'timestamp': timestamp,
            'confidence': data.get('confidence', 0.9)
        }, room=session_id)
```

### Collaborative Text Editor

```javascript
// Operational Transform for collaborative editing
class CollaborativeEditor {
    constructor(sessionId, userId) {
        this.sessionId = sessionId;
        this.userId = userId;
        this.socket = io();
        this.operationBuffer = [];
        this.setupEventListeners();
    }
    
    applyOperation(operation) {
        // Transform operation against concurrent operations
        const transformedOp = this.transformOperation(operation);
        
        // Apply to local document
        this.document.apply(transformedOp);
        
        // Broadcast to other users
        this.socket.emit('operation', {
            sessionId: this.sessionId,
            operation: transformedOp,
            userId: this.userId
        });
    }
    
    handleRemoteOperation(operation) {
        // Transform and apply remote operation
        const localOp = this.transformAgainstLocal(operation);
        this.document.apply(localOp);
        this.updateUI();
    }
}
```

### Live Audio Processing

```python
# Real-time audio processing pipeline
class LiveAudioProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.whisper_model = whisper.load_model("base")
        self.audio_buffer = AudioBuffer(sample_rate=16000)
        self.processing_queue = asyncio.Queue()
        
    async def process_audio_stream(self, audio_stream):
        async for audio_chunk in audio_stream:
            self.audio_buffer.add_chunk(audio_chunk)
            
            if self.audio_buffer.has_sufficient_data():
                await self.processing_queue.put(
                    self.audio_buffer.get_segment()
                )
    
    async def transcribe_worker(self):
        while True:
            audio_segment = await self.processing_queue.get()
            result = await self.transcribe_async(audio_segment)
            
            await self.broadcast_transcript_chunk(result)
```

### Conflict Resolution System

```python
# Handle simultaneous edits with operational transforms
class ConflictResolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.operation_history = []
        self.vector_clocks = {}
        
    def resolve_conflicts(self, operations):
        # Sort operations by vector clock
        sorted_ops = self.sort_by_causality(operations)
        
        # Apply operational transforms
        resolved_ops = []
        for op in sorted_ops:
            transformed_op = self.transform_against_history(op)
            resolved_ops.append(transformed_op)
            self.operation_history.append(transformed_op)
        
        return resolved_ops
    
    def transform_against_history(self, operation):
        # Transform operation against all concurrent operations
        for historical_op in self.get_concurrent_operations(operation):
            operation = self.operational_transform(operation, historical_op)
        return operation
```
