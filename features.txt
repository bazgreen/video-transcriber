Use ffmpeg to:

Split any long source video (e.g. w1.mp4)
Into uniform 5-minute chunks (w1_part_000.mp4, w1_part_001.mp4, …)
Save those parts to the working directory
🛠 Proposed Feature: Auto-split input video into 5-minute segments

New workflow:
Ask: "Do you want to split a long video first?"
If yes, ask for input file (e.g. w1.mp4)
Split it automatically into w1_part_XXX.mp4
Continue with the transcription pipeline

🎯 Additional Feature Ideas to Help Extract All Assessment Hints

1. Timestamped transcript
Add timestamps (approximate) per paragraph
Useful for jumping back to video/audio for clarification
2. Extract questions asked aloud
Identify anything phrased as a question (e.g. "What are we supposed to submit?")
These often include crucial clarifications or FAQs
3. Keyword cloud / frequency analysis
Helps you find patterns: which terms (e.g. "notebook", "outputs", "API") were most repeated?
4. Speaker emphasis cues
Highlight lines that include things like:
“make sure…”
“don’t forget…”
“this will definitely be on the assessment…”
5. Week tagging / output labelling
Tag outputs by week/session to make searching and revisiting easier
6. Searchable HTML transcript
Create an HTML file with collapsible sections, search/filter boxes, and highlighted key terms
✅ Want to go next level?

We could build:

A --split mode to break down any input video automatically
A --summarise mode to just extract key points without full transcript
A basic web interface to browse transcripts and highlights
