   - Good contrast and readability

2. **Desktop Screenshots (1280x800)**:

## Creating Screenshots

You can create these screenshots by:

- Taking actual screenshots of the running app
- Using browser developer tools to simulate devices
- Creating mockups with design tools

## Placeholder Screenshots

Until custom screenshots are created, you can use placeholder services:

- <https://via.placeholder.com/375x812/007bff/ffffff?text=Mobile+View>
- <https://via.placeholder.com/1280x800/007bff/ffffff?text=Desktop+View>

The PWA will work with placeholder screenshots, but real screenshots provide a better user experience and help users understand the app's interface before installing.
